# explore-youtube-asl
Messing around with [YouTube-ASL](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/youtube_asl). 

Ideas: 
* randomly select and embed [Youtube-ASL](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/youtube_asl) videos.
* Display a grid of random videos
* go through the list and see which ones have audio tracks in English

* Maybe with [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#seekTo)
